  <strong><u><h1> Facade Specificaiton requirements </h1></u></strong>
<br><br>
  <strong> 7.6.3	VISUAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA </strong>
<p>
The glass shall be clean cut, without significant edge faults (including feathered edges, shells or other imperfections) and free from bubbles,
inclusions, cracks ripping dimples or other defects.  Distortion shall be kept to an absolute minimum and no local defects producing irregular
reflections shall be allowed.</p>
<p>The quality of all glass shall be assessed for optical and visual faults as described in BS EN 572-2 and the requirement specified in section 7.6.1,
7.6.6 and 7.6.7 of this Specification. Spot faults shall not be worse than category C. There shall be no linear/extended faults. For optical faults,
 acceptance levels shall be as described in the standard.</p>
<p>In the absence of a British standard covering visual process blemishes in laminated glass, reference shall be made to ASTM C 1172 Table 3 for architectural quality glass.
Unless otherwise accepted by the Contract Administrator, three (3) 1x1m glass samples of each type, with the same tinting, heat treatment, coating and build-up, shall be submitted, prior to commencement on site, showing the final quality of the finished glass. The sample shall be to a standard agreed by the Contract Administrator.  The accepted trial samples shall be kept by the Contract Administrator as control samples (benchmark) of the acceptable range of visual deviations.
Also refer to section 7.6.1, 7.6.6, 7.6.7 and 9.4.2, for acceptance criterion on glass visual quality.</p>
<p>
<strong> 7.6.1	GENERAL </strong>
<p>Glass shall comply with the standards as specified in section 6 and the description in section 5.2.8 of this Specification.</p>
<p>Submit samples of glass in accordance with SCHEDULE 2.</p>
<p>The thickness and dimensions of glass shown on the Drawings are not prescribed thickness or dimensions.  The Contractor shall calculate the required glass thickness using the minimum
  thickness principle to meet the structural, thermal, environmental, acoustic and safety requirements.
Test report shall be prepared by the recognised independent test laboratory shall be submitted and reviewed without objection by the Contract Administrator prior to material ordering.</p>
One hundred percent heat soaking shall be required for all glass exceeding surface and edge stresses of 7500psi (52 N/mm²).  Contractor shall submit heat soak process and QC program for review without objection by Contract Administrator to ensure conformance with requirements listed in EN 14179 with calibrated heat soak ovens.  Temperature-time curve for heat soak testing of each batch of processed glass shall be recorded real-time and be witnessed by representative of the Contractor.  All heat soak test records issued by the glass manufacturer and countersigned by the contractor shall be submitted to the Contract Administrator for review following delivery of glass to the assembly factory or to site.
Heat-treated glass such as Heat strengthened glass and tempered glass shall be examined by the glass manufacturer to detect and discard any lites
which exceed the following tolerances:</p>
<p>1)	Glass that has any deviation from flat (bow) of 0.10% of the shortest glass dimension.</p>
<p>2)	Where the heat treating process results in essentially parallel ripples or waves (roller waves), the deviation from flatness at any peak
  shall not exceed 0.13mm, and the difference between adjacent peaks shall not exceed 0.08mm.</p>
<p>3)	Where bow tolerance and roller wave tolerance differ, the stricter requirements shall govern.
<p>4)	Direction of ripples shall be horizontal, consistent, and in conformance with architectural design.
The appearance of anisotropy or "Leopard Spots", a multi-coloured pattern, is known to be associated with heat treated glass under certain polarised lighting conditions.  This shall not be considered a fault unless it is visible in a range of reasonably typical naturally occurring conditions.  Any coatings applied to the glass must not increase the tendency to show these effects and samples must be submitted to the Contractor Administrator for review without objection.  Control samples, as indicated in SCHEDULE 2, shall be submitted for review without objection prior to ordering of the HKPM project glass.</p>
<p>5)	Bubbles and inclusions in glass panels are considered as unacceptable.</p>

<br><br>
  <strong> 7.6.6	TEMPERED GLASS  </strong>
<p> The Contractor must satisfy himself that glass tempering requirements are satisfactory to meet wind or other loads anticipated in the works. The prime
  manufacturer of the tempered glass shall be made aware of its intended use in the construction. Any drilling and notching shall be done with the
   agreement of the prime manufacturer of toughened glass and prior to the toughening being carried out. All toughened glass shall be tempered on
   a roller hearth furnace eliminating tong marks and shall conform to BS 6206 Class A.</p>
<p>All tempered glass shall be off line (i.e. glass allowed to cool down to room temperature for 24 hours prior to heat soaking) heat soak tested
  to EN 14179 by the glass manufacturer’s calibrated heat soak ovens equipped with digital thermal couples connected to a computer data acquisition
   system.  Real time temperature-time curve for heat soaking of each batch of processed glass shall be recorded and be witnessed by the
   independent laboratory appointed by the Contractor.  The accredited laboratory for the oven calibration and witnessing the heat soak process
   shall be nominated during tender stage for the Contract Administrator’s review without objection.</p>
<p>All heat soak test records issued by the glass manufacturer shall be countersigned by the accredited independent laboratory and the Contractor
  and shall be submitted to the Contract Administrator for review following glass delivery to the assembly factory or to site.  After the test the
  probability of failure in service shall be less than one in 400 tonnes.  The Contractor shall ensure that the manufacturer shall, at the request
  of the Contract Administrator, show by statistical analysis of test data that the probability of failure is not greater than the value quoted
  above. </p>
  <p> Edge working shall be flat ground with small ground arris and have a frosted appearance. Corners shall be dubbed.  Small shells and/or chips
     shall be ground out prior to toughening. Maximum chip/shell diameter shall not exceed 2mm, and there shall not be more than four randomly
     placed chip/shells in any single pane of glass.</p>
  <p>The surface compressive stress shall be demonstrated by non-destructive testing to be controlled at the factory within the range of
    70 N/mm² to 100 N/mm². </p>
<p>Unless otherwise accepted by the Contract Administrator, three (3) 1x1m samples of each with designated tinting, coating, heat treatment and
  built-up for each thickness of glass to demonstrate the roller wave, leopard spots, strain patterns, colour variations (tinting and coating),
  edge deletion, sealant quality and the like that shall be obtained.  The accepted samples shall be kept by the Contract Administrator as control
  samples (benchmark) of the acceptable range of visual deviations. </p>
